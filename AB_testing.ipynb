    "# Experiment Design\n",
    "To design the experiment, we first need to ask a few questions to target the right users in the experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target population:\n",
    "Who is the target population? Do we want to target all the users or a specific segment of users? To answer this question, it is possible to analyze the user's journey (funnel). For example, we could select only the users who have the intention to buy products and who started checking out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical significance boundary:\n",
    "Practical significance boundary, a.k.a. effect size: for example, we could agree that an increase of USD 2/user in revenue is practically significant. As a result, if the revenue increase by USD 2/user on average, we could launch the change to production\n",
    "\n",
    "## Power of the test:\n",
    "Probability of True Positive: detecting a given effect size when the effect is real. Probability = 1 - Beta.\n",
    "Industry standard: Power = 80%\n",
    "\n",
    "## Significance Level (alpha):\n",
    "Probability of a False Positive (Type II error) : Mistakenly concluding that an effect is real (when it's actually due to chance). Probability = alpha\n",
    "Industry standard: Significance level = 5%\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample size:\n",
    "What is the sample size of the experiment? How many user should be allocated randomly in each group?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size = (16*sigma^2) / delta^2\n",
    "with:\n",
    "- sigma: the standard deviation of the population\n",
    "- delta: difference between treatment and control\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume sigma is equal to 20. Then, the sample size is 16*20^2 / 2^2 = 1600 unique users in each variant. If there are 3 variants, we need a total population of 4800 unique users for 3 variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a smaller effect size (USD 1/user) or a smaller significance level (alpha=2.5%) has to be detected, then the sample size has to be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Duration:\n",
    "A number of elements can affect the duration of an experiment:\n",
    "- latency\n",
    "- time required to get the data\n",
    "- seasonality\n",
    "- primacy and novelty effects\n",

    "Defining a ramp-up plan allows to have no bugs and handle traffic without latency.\n",
    "- Expose to a small population\n",
    "- Gradually increase percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "- day 1: 5% of the treatment group\n",
    "- day 2: increase to 10% of the treatment group\n",
    "- day 3: increase to 33% of the tratment group\n",

    "Assuming there are 2000 users / day entering checkout while purchasing products, then the experiment needs to run for a minimum of 4 days:\n",

    "day 1: 33% => 660\n",
    "\n",
    "### Day of week effect:\n",
    "People behave differently during an entire week. As a result, the experiment should run for at least an entire week to capture this effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonality\n",
    "Data during holidays cannot be used for analysis and the experiment must run longer\n",
